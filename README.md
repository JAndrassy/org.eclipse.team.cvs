# Eclipse CVS Client

This is the original Eclipse CVS Client plugin extracted from the now empty [eclipse.platform.team](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.team) repository. The Eclipse Team stopped maintaining the plugin and removed it from the Eclipse code base in 2022. The rest of the Eclipse Team sources were moved to [Eclipse core](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform). This git repository is a copy of the eclipse.platform.team repository so it preserves the commits history of the plugins sources.
